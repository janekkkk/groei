This project uses NX monorepo using Pnpm. Typescript everywhere. Vite React with Tailwind and ShadCdn on the frontend,
Deno Hono with Drizzle and Sqlite on the backend. Look at the package.json files for more info. The application is used
a self hosted app, which helps me to manage my garden (mostly vegetables). I use this app in the garden from my phone (
to choose which seeds to plant where) but also from my laptop mostly to add new seeds.
