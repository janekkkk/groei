# BladWijzer ðŸŒ¿

BladWijzer is an offline-first, mobile-friendly web application designed as a plant logbook, allowing users to track their plants' growth, care routines, and other personal notes. Built using React, it utilizes TypeScript and Vite for fast development, along with Tailwind CSS for styling.
It's just something I'm just making for myself to keep track of what's happening in my garden and what to do next.
